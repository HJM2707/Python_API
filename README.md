# Python_API
using API to get data from open-weather and geo-apifi
# Step1:Creating new repo
###### Creating new repo and adding the files to it, this time using gitignore.
###### Generating API keys from openweather web and geopify
## Step2: using api to import data in json

###### using the starter code file of weather.ipynb and vacation.ipynb in a sequence for importing cities search using random lat and long array list. 
###### api call were made first in weather starter code and parameters were choosen.
###### the results were exported in cities_weather.csv and then imported back and worked on as dataframe.
###### using weather dataframe to explore scatter plot analysis based on;
###### Latitude vs. Temperature
###### Latitude vs. Humidity
###### Latitude vs. Cloudiness
###### Latitude vs. Wind Speed

## Step 3:Linear Regression 
###### Linear regression analysis were carried to see the relationship of northern and souther hemispheres with humidity, max temperature, wind and cloudiness

## Step 4:Geoapify 
###### Using cities_weather.csv file to import the cities lat and long and then map the geoview with maps and creating dots, 
###### further narrow down the cities_weather DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition on following parameters:
###### > A max temperature lower than 27 degrees but higher than 21

###### > Wind speed less than 4.5 m/s

###### >Zero cloudiness
